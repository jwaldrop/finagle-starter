Steps to run program:

0) Start up Zookeeper on localhost, I used:
  http://apache.ziply.com/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.3/
  after downloading you must copy the sample conf file locally or it won't start
  startup scripts are in the bin directory
  other than the conf file, it starts up with no problem

1) chmod +x bin/sbt

2) In a shell: ./bin/sbt run  -- pick number 1 (the server)
   (note: port 1233 must be available)

3) In another shell: ./bin/sbt run -- pick number 2 (the client)
